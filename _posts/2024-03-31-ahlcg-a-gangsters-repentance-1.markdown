# Introduction

This will be a documented playthrough of The Innsmouth Conspiracy with Michael McGlen and Father Mateo. I've been wanting to do something like this for a while and [DerBK's The Drowned City playthrough](https://derbk.com/ancientevils/drowned-city-blind-play-tdccore-0-campaign-setup-and-intro/) was the inspiration I needed to get started.

The main focus will be on the gameplay but I want to try and sprinkle in some flavor where possible, as one of my favourite aspects of Arkham is the emergent storytelling. While I have played The Innsmouth Conspiracy once before, it's been a while and I will try to play as if it's my first time, because it is the first time for the investigators!

# Deckbuilding

To spice things up, in the same vein as DerBK's playthrough I will use certain deckbuilding restrictions. The only investigator packs available to each investigator will be:

* Core set.
* Starter investigator sets (Stella, Winifred, Jacqueline, Harvey, Nathaniel).
* Campaign's investigator set.
* Investigator's own set.

In our case, this means since we're playing through The Innsmouth Conspiracy, both investigators have access to Core set, starter sets, and Innsmouth sets. Michael McGlen then has The Drowned City, and Father Mateo has The Forgotten Age. This seems like a great compromise between restricting options for more interesting deckbuilding decisions, and maintaining theme and synergy by sticking with cards specifically designed with the current investigator/campaign in mind. It also means the card pool will rotate a lot depending on any given campaign runthrough.

I will also use the latest tabboo (2024-10-23).

I'll be two-handing this playthrough, and have been keen to try out {%investigator Michael McGlen%} from The Drowned City. He's very much focused on one thing and one thing only, guns, which means we need a strong cluever to progress the act deck. A strong seeker could work, but I've always had a fondness for {%investigator Father Mateo%} as his theming is very evocative in the world of Arkham, and his ability very powerful. We also get a great backstory for our campaign: Michael McGlen is looking to right the wrongs of a lifetime of crime, so reaches out to a man of God, Father Mateo, to help him repent and find redemption. As for how they end up in the mysterious seaside town of Innsmouth... we'll have to play through the campaign to find out.

## Michael McGlen

<img style="width:300px; height: auto" src="/assets/2025-04-20-ahlcg-a-gangsters-repentance-1/michael-mcglen.JPG" />

[[Full deck]](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/4878274)

McGlen wants guns. Lots of guns. I think he's really interesting investigator because he forces the use of firearms instead of melee weapons which are typically considered the superior weapons for fighters. Due to the deckbuilding restrictions we're a bit limited in what we can take. E.g. {%card Chicago Typewriter%} and {%card .45 Thompson%}, the quintessential gangster weapons, are no-go.

{%card .18 Derringer%},  {%card .41 Derringer%},  {%card .45 Automatic%},  {%card Luger P08%},  {%card Remington Model 1858%}, {%card .25 Automatic%}, and {%card Mauser C96%} are our options. Ten guns in the deck seems about right. With {%card Robert Castaigne%} we can't really have too many. Of those, the .25 isn't useful because neither Michael nor Mateo plan to be doing much evading. The Mauser exhausts on use which could leave us vulnerable, especially if we have the Luger in the other hand (which we'll typically want for the free action and resource generation).
 
As mentioned above, Castaigne allows us to not worry about overdrawing guns, since he can fire them off as cheap events. The extra fight is super solid and means Michael should have no problem hitting most enemies without committing. It's also nice to play a rogue without Leo for once.
 
That's the core of the deck sorted. We need to figure out what support cards we want.  {%card "Where's the Party?"%} could be useful if we're all setup but aren't drawing enemies from the encounter deck. It can also search for victory points.  {%card Bum's Rush%} is great deck-tech, it tests at 8 baseline, which is incredible, and can allow us to totally ignore a non-hunting enemy by punting it to an explored location. Michael should be swimming in resources, so  {%card Hard Knocks%} and  {%card "You've had Worse..."%} are  great resource dumps.  {%card Crack Shot%} seems like a no-brainer for helping with tougher enemies, and the suite of  {%card Guts%},  {%card Manual Dexterity%}, and  {%card Overpower%} rounds out our skills.
 
{%card Lucky Cigarette Case%} is the only available accessory slot asset available to us and seems to fit well. Card draw is always good and we'll be over-succeeding a lot with such high fight. It does take up  {%card "Viola" Case%}'s slot, but we don't really need the extra hand slots so will likely want to commit it most of the time. Finally, Michael at least wants to appear to help out Mateo with {%card Pilfer%}. It tests at base 4 which isn't great, but on a low shroud with a few commits, grabbing three clues in one action could prove pivotal. 

## Father Mateo

<img style="width:auto; height: auto" src="/assets/2025-04-20-ahlcg-a-gangsters-repentance-1/father-mateo.jpg" />

[[Full deck]](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/4878405)

The Good Father is going to be harder to build than McGlen. His primary task is clueing but the deck restrictions limit him significantly in spells that investigate. The options are {%card Clairvoyance%},  {%card Eye of Chaos%}, and  {%card Rite of Seeking(2)%}. The Forgotten Age didn't include an arcane asset for investigating, maybe because of Mateo's somewhat respectable 3 intelligence which makes it possible to perform the regular old style of investigating. Eye of Chaos doesn't make sense for us since we're not using curse tokens. An option could be to spend four of our five starting experience on Rite of Seeking, but there are some other things I want to spend those on...

I want to incorporate {%icon bless%} (bless) tokens into the deck, since it seems like such a win thematically and I've never built a deck around them before.

For {%icon bless%} generation, the gold standard is {%card Keep Faith%} so that's an auto-include. {%card Hand of Fate%} is a situational and expensive dodge that adds {%icon bless%}, so we'll take one of those. {%card Book of Psalms%} is also very expensive, both in resources and actions, but will help McGlen's sanity problems while also filling the bag with blesses. Unfortunately there aren't a whole lot more ways to get blesses into the bag, short of going a more fighty route with {%card Blessed Blade%} and {%card Righteous Hunt%}, but that's not feasible with Mateo's low fight and how much it would harm our clueing ability. Once we have some experience, {%card Holy Rosary(2)%} will be an important upgrade, and we'll include the level 0 version, {%card Holy Rosary%}, for a willpower boost. {%card St. Hubert's Key%} would have been great, since we're planning to use both willpower and intelligence to investigate, but it's from Carcosa.

The reason for going bless is Mateo has a huge amount of powerful payoff. {%card Rite of Sanctification%} can provide a huge 10 resources shared amongst both investigators, though I expect it will rarely get that full value. I'm hoping this will facilitate lots of the high resource cost cards in both decks. {%card Favor of the Sun%} and {%card Ancient Covenant%} is a hugely powerful combo that allows three auto-successes, which is self explanatorily great. {%card Radiant Smite%}, like McGlen's {%card Pilfer%}, is included mostly to show a willingness to adapt and help Michael if shit gets real. {%card Ward of Radiance%} is like a free {%card Ward of Protection%}, with the downside of being unreliable without lots of blesses in the bag. This might end up whiffing more than it's worth. We'll include a regular Ward of Protection as well.

For skills, {%card Enraptured%} allows us to gain more valuable charges on {%card Clairvoyance%}, which is our only big investigation tool for now. {%card Prescient%} synergises with bless tokens and potentally allows us to recurse important spells such as {%card Clairvoyance%} or {%card Ward of Protection%}. 

{%card Flashlight%} is included as secondary clueing power if {%card Clairvoyance%} isn't available, or for low shroud locations. Finally, {%card Olive McBride%} offers decent soak and synergises with some of our bless cards like {%card Ward of Radiance%}.

I'm less confident about this deck than I am about Michael's. We'll be hard mulliganing for {%card Keep Faith%} and {%card Clairvoyance%}. I think upgrades will make or break the deck.

## Weaknesses

For weaknesses I like to draw three, discard one, and randomly select between the remaining two. This allows the elimination of disasterous weaknesses that would heavily punish any given deck, while still staying true to the thematic implications of a random weakness.

{%inline Paranoia%}

Michael draw {%card Your Worst Nightmare%}, {%card Paranoia%}, and {%card Obsessive%}. {%card Your Worst Nightmare%}, while incredible from a thematic perspective (with Mateo being the only one to absolve McGlen of his darkest sins), it would have been too punishing since Mateo has very few ways to deal with a three health monster. McGlen ended up being burdened with {%card Paranoia%}, which is still somewhat appropriate given his propensity for gaining resources.

{%inline Day of Reckoning%}

Mateo's options were {%card The Thing That Follows%}, {%card Day of Reckoning%}, and {%card Indebted%}. For similar reasons to above, {%card The Thing That Follows%} would have been pretty bad though not terrible, typically taking McGlen a couple of actions to deal with (since "Prey - Bearer only" means he would have to engage it). In any case, I really wanted {%card Day of Reckoning%} since it seems such a thematic weakness given Mateo's strong Elder Sign. {%card Paranoia%} is a pretty boring weakness, and while it would have been easier to deal with than {%card Day of Reckoning%}, I was very pleased when the latter was selected.

# Scenario 1 - The Pit of Despair

The first thing I noticed when setting up the campaign was the size of the chaos bag. 20 tokens! That's far more than others, which typically have 16 or in the case of Forgotten Age (Mateo's 'home' campaign) 14. This immediately reduces the effectiveness of Mateo's inherently powerful Elder Sign ability and his deck built on bless tokens. Lets hope we remove some chaos tokens at some point in the campaign.

Father Mateo will be guilding us through the darkness, as lead investigator for the first scenario.

During setup it's revealed that uncovering flashbacks could potentially remove tokens from the chaos bag, so that will be a high priority secondary objective for the duo.

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-04-20-ahlcg-a-gangsters-repentance-1/R0001030.JPG" />

Mateo's opening hand is {%card Clairvoyance%}, {%card Rite of Sanctification%}, {%card Book of Psalms%}, {%card Hand of Fate%}, and {%card Ward of Radiance%}. Not bad, we have a way to supercharge clueing and a way to put blesses in the bag, though quite conditionally.

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-04-20-ahlcg-a-gangsters-repentance-1/R0001031.JPG" />

Michael doesn't fare too bad either, finding {%card Robert Castaigne%}, {%card Overpower%}, {%card .45 Automatic%}, {%card Luger P08%}, and {%card "You've had Worse..."%}. That should be enough firepower to begin with though we've already run into resource issues. Lets hope Mateo can get some blesses going to activate {%card Rite of Sanctification%} ASAP.

## Round 1

Lets assess. We've woken up with no idea what's happening, in an underground cavern that's slowly flooding due to the tides. We need to get out, and deal with the beasties we can hear rumbling around nearby. There's a key on our location, though we're not sure what it's for yet. To take it it we'll need to find two clues, which will also take us a third of the way to completing Act 1. We also know that the keys themselves are pretty horrific since we risk taking horror when holding them and drawing a {%icon tab%} token from the bag.

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-04-20-ahlcg-a-gangsters-repentance-1/R0001033.JPG" />

There's no immediate danger so we can do some setup. Mateo plays {%card Clairvoyance%} and then investigates, committing {%card Book of Psalms%} and {%card Ward of Radiance%}, since they are of little use at the moment. {%icon fail%}. Ok, well it is a shame to use Mateo's superpower so early in the scenario, but it's such a tempo swing it has to be done. From the Elder Sign we're going to draw a card (another {%card Ward of Radiance%}) and gain a resource. We succeed, so get the two clues and take control of 'a piece of amber in the shape of a fish's heart, that whispers something alien when you hold it'. Revealing a new location as a final action could be bad, so we're going to draw, hoping for {%card Keep Faith%} but finding another {%card Clairvoyance%} instead.

McGlen plays his {%card .45 Automatic%}, gains a resource, and plays the {%card Luger P08%}. Castaigne will have to wait, guns are more important for Michael right now.

During upkeep, Mateo draws {%card Unexpected Courage%} and McGlen draws {%card Guts%}. Both could help with the upcoming...

## Round 2

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-04-20-ahlcg-a-gangsters-repentance-1/R0001035.JPG" />

Mythos phase. Two {%card Swarm of Rats%}! Note that this is two separate swarms of rats, not one huge swarm of rats! Important distinction. There be rats in these tunnels, but what are they running from and where are they going, other than up Mateo's trousers?

McGlen's five {%icon str%} (he actually has F I V E tattooed on the fingers of his clenched fist) makes it unnecessary to spend any ammo dispatching the swarms. He rolls once, he rolls twice, and by magic the rats are dispatched. He then explores the eastern tidal tunnel, revealing an {%card Underground River%}. Lots of clues and a victory point, but not the easiest for Mateo to investigate right now.

Mateo wouldn't be much of a priest if he abandoned his brother at the first sign of hardship, so he follows Michael into the underground river. Clearing the clues is potentially two activations of {%card Clairvoyance%}, though some commits will be needed. Thankfully, with his {%card Unexpected Courage%} and Michael's {%card Guts%}, we have options. +2 is a 14/20 chance, while +3 is 17/20. For the first investigate, Mateo goes +3 and reveals... {%icon +1%}! That's two clues but also one horror from Clairvoyance as Mateo glimpses slightly more than he intended... Once more, Mateo investigates at +3, committing {%card Hand of Fate%} in addition to McGlen's {%card Guts%}. That's a skull, so {%icon -2%} and another successful investigate. Michael draws {%card Pilfer%} off the {%card Guts%}, and we have enough clues to advance, though we'll wait until the start of the next investigator phase to do so.

During upkeep, McGlen draws {%card Remington Model 1858%}, which might be helpful in dispatching Mateo's new friend, {%card Serpents of Yig%}. I guess it's not just servants of Dagon we're fighting down here, but manifestations of Mateo's past as well.

## Round 3

The mythos throws two sticky treacheries at us. Mateo foolishly decides to wade into the river (maybe following the alien whispers of the amber fish heart) and gets pulled under by the {%card Undertow%}. Michael thinks he can make out singular cyclopean structures in the cavernous depths, his {%card Dreams of R'lyeh%} affecting his willpower and sanity.

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-04-20-ahlcg-a-gangsters-repentance-1/R0001040.JPG" />

Assaulted by the currents and his serpentine friend, Mateo is not in a state to act. McGlen to the rescue! Escaping from his daydream, he takes aim with his {%card .45 Automatic%} and {%card Luger P08%}. Michael has not forgotten the face of his father, and downs the monster in a one-two salvo, costing only one action and gaining two resources in the process. The Luger has its uses! A two against three test on {%card Dreams of R'lyeh%} seems unwise so it seems these dreams will be recurrent for now. With the loot dropped by the serpent, Michael can afford the services of {%card Robert Castaigne%}, but first we will advance the act by spending the six clues on Father Mateo.

Wow, a lot has just happened, and our decision to delay the advance was vindicated.

* We have a big bad to replace the serpent that Michael just offed. {%card The Amalgam%} is a huge deep one abomination and it's on top of Mateo. The Good Father just can't catch a break!
* We've discovered additional passageways through the caverns, unblocking progress further into the depths. One of these locations should have the means of escape.
* We gained insight into our past and what led us here. We're investigating the disappearance of Elina Harper, an agent under a WW1 veteran called Thomas Dawson. She was last known investigating the mysterious town of Innsmouth. We don't know our motives for helping Agent Dawson yet, it can be assumed they are not purely financial as that doesn't seem becoming of a priest like Mateo. Perhaps a sort of penance for Michael's sins? In any case, the flashback ends as Dawson's face merges with one of many faces grafted onto The Amalgam. Was this Dawson's fate or just a delusion of madness? In any case, we have more pressing concerns...

{%card The Amalgam%} has Mateo's key and also has him pinned in the river. Thankfully McGlen has two actions remaining. The abomination is not difficult to scare away, but can be assumed to re-appear at the most inconvenient time. With pinpoint accuracy (and the Elder Sign), McGlen places a .45 directly in (one of) The Amalgam's heads, which has it rearing back in pain. While it's staggered, Michael finishes with a punch into the gyrating mass of flesh and tentacles, managing to {%card Overpower%} the abomination and sent it shuffling back into the depths. In a bout of {%card Paranoia%}, Michael believes he's being assaulted from all directions and loses all his resources before the delusion fades. Castaigne will have to wait a while longer...

With his actions spent, Michael triggers the fast action on {%card Undertow%} to try and grab Mateo before he's fully taken by the tide. He discards {%card Pilfer%} and pulls a {%icon -1%}, successfully pulling Mateo onto dry (ish) land.

Shaking off the cold and catching his breath, Mateo spends his turn drawing, in an attempt to find ways of adding bless to the chaos bag. First is {%card Enraptured%}, which might prove valuable getting {%card Clairvoyance%} back online. Next is {%card Olive McBride%}, and third is {%card Guts%}. Could have been worse but not what we were looking for.

During upkeep, Michael draws another {%card "You've had Worse..."%} which is mostly commit-fodder at the moment, while Mateo draws his second weakness, {%card Day of Reckoning%}. At least that's both out of the way now, but not great to be without the Elder Sign for four rounds.

## Round 4

The Mythos gifts Mateo with a {%card Young Deep One%} (along with a horror), and Michael a second {%card Dreams of R'lyeh%}. Those dreams are getting pretty intense right now, giving Michael 1 willpower and 3 sanity, which is a bit much to ignore. Mateo will probably have to provide an intervention.

First things first, Michael takes aim at the deep one and pulls the {%icon tab%}, dealing two damage, before going in for the finish with the Luger, pulling the {%icon cult%} this time. The {%card Young Deep One%} collapses back into the river from whence it came. The Luger will need to be reloaded at some point, but Michael decides to save the resources for Castaigne, in-fact he spends his last two actions getting more resources.

Mateo still wants to draw into some bless cards, and committing {%card Guts%} into Michael's {%card Dreams of R'lyeh%} is one way to do so. He succeeds and draws {%card Favor of the Sun%}, which will complete the combo with {%card Ancient Covenant%} but unfortunately still doesn't actually provide bless tokens! With two more draws, he finds {%card Arcane Studies%} which will be useful with the resources he's been accumulating, and {%card The Codex of Ages%}, which has me checking whether the Elder Sign currently sealed on {%card Day of Reckoning%} can be re-sealed on the Codex... Turns out it cannot, which is a shame.

We've been at this underground river for too long, we need to move next round come rain or shine (and I'm pretty sure which of those we're gonna get). Upkeep, Mateo draws {%card Unexpected Courage%}, and is at the hand limit of 8, while Michael draws {%card "Where's the Party?"%} (spoiler, it's in the underground river and Michael has been 'killing it'.) On the upside, things are looking pretty calm right now, and unless something drastic happens in the mythos phase, we should be good to continue progressing the scenario next round...

## Round 5

Mateo: {%card Clairvoyance%} {%card Rite of Sanctification%} {%card Enraptured%} {%card Olive McBride%} {%card Favor of the Sun%} {%card Arcane Studies%} {%card The Codex of Ages%}
McGlen: {%card Robert Castaigne%} {%card Remington Model 1858%} {%card "You've had Worse..."%} {%card "Where's the Party?"%}

You know when I just said unless something dramatic happens in the mythos phase. Yeah. Mateo pulls an {%icon tent%} from the bag while testing {%card Macabre Memento%}, failing by 1, taking two horror and retrieving {%card The Amalgam%} from the depths. Yay. McGlen draws {%card Memory of Oblivion%} and tests two against four. Mateo helps out with some {%card Unexpected Courage%}. McGlen pulls the autofail, discarding his entire hand.

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-04-20-ahlcg-a-gangsters-repentance-1/R0001041.JPG" />

Michael unloads once again into the abomination, first action whiffing with a {%icon -4%} token, second one barely succeeding with a {%icon -3%}. That's the .45 empty and still one health remaining. Michael quickly reloads the {%card Luger P08%} before firing off a shot and scraping {%card The Amalgam%} enough to have it tottering off back to the depths. Learning point: Never test at less than +3!

Mateo knows we can't afford to delay any longer, so he explores further east, revealing {%card Tidal Pool%} and putting two set aside tidal tunnels east and south of it. It has two clues, and a key. Mateo will want to investigate this fast before it gets flooded. To that end, out comes the second {%card Clairvoyance%} for four of Mateo's six resources, and immediately uses it to investigate. At least having the Elder Sign sealed means a lower chance of taking 1 horror from Clairvoyance! Swings and roundabouts. Mateo commits {%card The Codex of Ages%} to go +3, and pulls a {%icon -2%}, success! Two clues and a key, which this time is 'a calcified piece of chitin in the shape of a tentacle'. Sexy.

During upkeep, Mateo draws {%card Ward of Protection%} and Michael draws {%card Bum's Rush%}, which could be especially useful for a big non-hunter enemy.

## Round 6

Two rounds before the agenda advances, and we get the Elder Sign back. Here's hoping we can make some decent progress towards finding the exit, unless the mythos says nope again. Speaking of which, the mythos says {%card From the Depths%} to Mateo, and Mateo says fuck you six ways to Sunday with {%card Ward of Protection%}. Gosh, that felt good, though Mateo's sanity isn't looking too great with five horror. Thankfully we can play Olive soon to give the priest some respite.

Unfortunately, Michael draws {%card Blindsense%} and without any cards to commit for agility, is reliant on drawing a {%icon 0%} or {%icon +1%} to prevent a third encounter with {%card The Amalgam%}. It really doesn't want to accept defeat at the battle of underground river, does it? However, by some stroke of luck or sheer force of will, Michael does pull a {%icon 0%} and The Amalgam remains in the depths.

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-04-20-ahlcg-a-gangsters-repentance-1/R0001042.JPG" />

Finally we have a round of relative calm. Mateo will push even further east to reveal an {%card Underwater Cavern%}, coming into play with two clues and a full flood token. Mateo will have to leave by the end of the next round or take five damage, but there's no need to stick around. The final tidal tunnel can enter play to the south, which creates an efficient path back to other unrevealed locations, with no backtracking. Given no immediate need for the clues on the underwater cavern, Mateo immediately explores south, revealing another {%card Underwater Cavern%}. There's the option of using the >Move here to teleport back to McGlen (presumably riding the current like tube at a water park), but this is less efficient for revealing all the locations, which we want to do, so Mateo makes one final move east, revealing... {%card Sealed Exit%}!

It can't be used yet though, as we need to find the green key to unlock the grate. Unfortunately, the {%card Underwater Cavern%} could have provided a quick route back to the exit if they were better positions. I also realised I probably should have played {%card Olive McBride%} for soak instead of moving. Mateo will have to survive one more mythos phase without her.

Meanwhile, Michal is getting pretty sick with the motherfucking abominations in this motherfucking {%card Underground River%}, and wants to get the hell out of dodge. He'll move south to reveal {%card Bone-ridden Pit%}, which hardly sounds much better. It does however lead to another flashback, given we discover the clues and posess the yellow key, which we do. It's a mighty six shroud but will be reduced to four if both Mateo and Michael bring their respective keys, which is more doable but still rough. Michael is in desperate need of a new gun after dropping them all while recounting his {%card Memory of Oblivion%} a few rounds ago (kids, never remember oblivion!) So he draws into {%card "Viola" Case%} and then plays it. The extra hand slots are not very useful, but the search is very useful right now. Unfortunately he doesn't have any remaining actions to play the {%card .18 Derringer%} he found (the choice was between that and the {%card .41 Derringer%}, it seemed better to take the guaranteed +1 damage over the extra ammo).

Both drew {%card Guts%} in the upkeep phase.

## Round 7

{%card Rising Tides%} causes an inconsequential flood level increase to the {%card Tidal Pool%} we've already visited. Michael draws {%card Fractured Consciousness%}. He can shrug off the two damage, the only risk is pulling the {%icon tent%} token and spawning {%card The Amalgam%}, but there's nothing we can do to raise his paltry intelligence, so we just have to hope for the best. We draw a {%icon -2%}. Note to self: {%card Olive McBride%} is useful to avoid the {%icon tent%} in a test that is otherwise unpassable.

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-04-20-ahlcg-a-gangsters-repentance-1/R0001043.JPG" />

Father Mateo swims to be reunited with Michael (and his guns). This puts the shroud at four and with the {%card Guts%} we just draw, we should be able to clear this location and unlock the second flashback. Before forgetting, Mateo plays {%card Olive McBride%} and then investigates with {%card Clairvoyance%}. This is am important test so we're going to throw a lot at it. Michael and Mateo both commit {%card Guts%}, giving +4. Mateo commits {%card Favor of the Sun%}, since it seems we're never going to get any bless tokens in the bag this scenario. He then uses {%card Olive McBride%} to draw three tokens and resolve two of them. The odds of failure without Olive are 1/19 (the autofail), and the odds of failure with Olive would require lots of math to determine but basically would mean drawing the autofail, and some combination of tokens that results in -6 or less, which my gut says is rarer than 1/19. Mateo draws {%icon +1%}, {%icon -3%}, {%icon -2%}, which is a solid pass. We can actually resolve the {%icon -3%} and {%icon -2%} and still pass, avoiding the horror we'd have got resolving the {%icon +1%}. Mateo draws {%card Enraptured%} and Michael draws another {%card .18 Derringer%}. Mateo will need to find some low shroud locations to investigate with intelligence, so {%card Enraptured%} can put some charges back onto {%card Clairvoyance%}. Finally, we get the two clues and flashback two.

The bones we're stood on jog a memory of fighting some enormous aquatic creature while trying to escape in a fishing vessel. For anyone familiar with The Call of Cthulhu story, that should seem terrifyingly familiar. We get to remove a {%icon cult%} token from the bag, which doesn't help much with this scenario, we'd have much preferred removing the {%icon tent%}.

Michael unholsters his {%card .18 Derringer%}. Thanks to {%card "Viola" Case%}, he doesn't have to discard the .45, and while it doesn't have any ammo anymore, if Michael draws his weakness it will get shuffled back into the deck instead of being discarded. He then moves east and reveals the second {%card Underground River%}. It would be nice to get the victory here but it's not the highest priority. Not wanting to get too far from Mateo, he stays put and takes a resource.

During upkeep, Mateo draws {%card Flashlight%} which will help enable {%card Enraptured%}, while Michael draws a second {%card Bum's Rush%}.

## Round 8

The agenda flips, we get the Elder Sign back, and presumably bad stuff will happen. Ah yes. Bad stuff did happen. Everywhere is flooded, and half the locations are fully flooded. Thankfully, the the new agenda has 8 doom threshold which feels like enough to see out the rest of the locations (though we know how optimism is punished in Arkham Horror). Mateo draws {%card Lurking Deep One%} taking a damage in the engage, and Michael draws {%card Riptide%}, which is totally fine because Michael has plenty of guns to discard. Turns out, it's not fine as he pulls the {%icon tent%} and {%card The Amalgam%} is back! The .45 is lost to the riptide but that's no biggie (unlike the monstrosity that just appeared).

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-04-20-ahlcg-a-gangsters-repentance-1/R0001045.JPG" />
<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-04-20-ahlcg-a-gangsters-repentance-1/R0001046.JPG" />

Michael has a bit of a problem now. He's on a fully flooded location (_editor note: this was a mistake, the location can't be fully flooded. I fix this in a few rounds_), so can't end his turn on another fully flooded location (well, he could survive with 2 health remaining but that seems bad). Ideally {%card The Amalgam%} dies in two hits (one action because of the Luger), then he moves back to the {%card Bone-ridden Pit%} to use his final action saving Mateo from the {%card Lurking Deep One%}. That's a lot of tests that need to succeed though! This seems like a good opportunity to use a {%card Bum's Rush%}. Michael tests 8 vs 2 and succeeds by four, stealing back the key, dealing a damage, and exhausting the abomination. Unfortunately since it's elite, it can't be shoved somewhere else. Michael then moves to Mateo and shoots the deep one with the .18. He pulls an {%icon tent%}, but this time it's still a success and Mateo is free again, and Michael gets a resource for his trouble.

Mateo moves west twice, since he started in a partially flooded location he can afford to end in a fully flooded one. Passing the disorientated abomination in the underground river, he reveals the {%card Idol Chamber%}, which gives access to the fourth flashback with the purple key, which we haven't found yet. Mateo then plays a {%card Flashlight%}.

During upkeep, {%card The Amalgam%} readies, Mateo draws {%card Prescient%}, and Michael draws {%card Manual Dexterity%}.

## Round 9

Mateo: {%card Rite of Sanctification%} (one of these days...) 2x{%card Enraptured%} {%card Arcane Studies%} {%card Prescient%}
Michael: {%card Bum's Rush%} {%card .18 Derringer%} {%card Manual Dexterity%}

Mateo draws {%card Riptide%}. He's not worried about losing the empty {%card Clairvoyance%}, but will activate Olive to potentially avoid a {%icon cult%} (1 damage), or {%icon tab%} (1 horror). Michael draws another {%card Fractured Consciousness%} and takes another two damage.

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-04-20-ahlcg-a-gangsters-repentance-1/R0001047.JPG" />
<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-04-20-ahlcg-a-gangsters-repentance-1/R0001048.JPG" />

There are three unrevealed locations left, and we still need the green key, purple key, and two flashbacks. The {%card Idol Chamber%} requires the purple key to unlock flashback four. The green key is required to escape. The yellow key was used in {%card Bone-ridden Pit%}. So, one location will require the red key for flashback three, and the other two locations will contain the purple and green key.

Mateo moves north and reveals {%card Fish Graveyard%} ("Dr. Fishy! Noooooo!") We control a key so don't take horror, and this is a two shroud location which is perfect with {%card Flashlight%} and {%card Enraptured%}. Unfortunately we used Olive in the mythos phase so we can't guarantee the investigate. We commit {%card Enraptured%} and succeed, putting a charge on {%card Clairvoyance%} and gaining one of the two clues. Repeat once more with the second {%card Enraptured%}, succeed and get the final clue. Unfortunately Michael has the red key so we'll have to wait for him to unlock the third flashback, and he has bigger fish to fry right now. SPEAKING OF BIG FISH.

We're going to take {%card The Amalgam%} on a wild McGlen chase. Michael moves north, back to the {%card Underground River%} which is fully flooded, but that's not a problem since we started on a partially flooded location. He'll then draw some cards. There's a risk of getting his weapons confiscated by the fish police but better now than when we really needed them. Ends up drawing {%card .41 Derringer%} and {%card Luger P08%}. We really need our friend {%card Robert Castaigne%} with all these guns in hand.

During the enemy phase (oh yeah, I'd forgotten what having to do something during one of these was like), {%card The Amalgam%} hunts towards McGlen, moving to the bone pit, which puts it out of harms way for a few turns. Mateo then finally draws {%card Keep Faith%} and Michael, as baited, draws {%card Confiscation%}. Michael is feeling prety naked right now, but thankfully there are plenty of guns in hand to play. The only risk now is drawing an enemy in the...

## Round 10

Mythos phase, Mateo draws {%card Deep One Bull%} (discarding {%card Rite of Sanctification%}) and Michael draws {%card Deep One Assault%}. So much for not drawing enemies huh. Unfortunately the bull is two locations away from Michael so the assault can't draw the bull off Mateo, and another enemy has to be found from the encounter deck. At least we get to choose a {%card Lurking Deep One%}, which deals a damage as it engages but can be neutered with a single {%card Bum's Rush%}.

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-04-20-ahlcg-a-gangsters-repentance-1/R0001049.JPG" />
<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-04-20-ahlcg-a-gangsters-repentance-1/R0001050.JPG" />

Michael, being two locations from Mateo, can't deal with both his foe and Mateo's, but if he ends up at Mateo's location he has {%card Manual Dexterity%} to commit to an evasion test. {%card Bum's Rush%} succeeds by 3 so the {%card Lurking Deep One%} gets punted into the tidal pool and Michael is free to move to Mateo.

Mateo plays {%card Keep Faith%}, then attempts an evasion on {%card Deep One Bull%}. With help from McGlen he's +3. The quesion is, do we trigger {%card Olive McBride%}? With {%card Ancient Covenant%}, each bless token is a success, which gives a 2 in 24 chance to fail without Olive. With Olive we can only make an educated guess. If any of the three revealed tokens are bless, {%icon +1%}, or Elder Sign, it's an auto success. Running some quick calculations, there's a 42% chance of not finding one of those tokens, and if that happens, we'd need two tokens to be {%icon -1%}/{%icon -2%} or better. My hunch says Olive puts us in a worse position, so we're going to go without. We draw an {%icon tent%}, passing by 0, evading the bull, and Michael draws another {%card .41 Derringer%}.

With the immediate threat dealt with, the amber fish heart in the {%card Fish Graveyard%} triggers something in Michael, and we get treated to the third flashback. Not much is revealed other than ominous portents, but we do remove another token, a {%icon tab%} this time. Still not an {%icon tent%}. Lets hope the fourth flashback provides.

Mateo moves west, revealing {%card Altar to Dagon%}. I realise my mistake in not collecting the blue key when I was at its location. The backtracking will be painful, costing four actions in total. One positive is Mateo already has the four clues required once we do get back. Since there's no point hanging around the altar with nothing to do, Mateo moves back to Michael as his last action.

During the enemy phase, {%card The Amalgam%} hunts north to the {%card Underground River%}. During upkeep, the {%card Lurking Deep One%} readies but won't be a threat any longer since it doesn't hunt. {%card Deep One Bull%} readies and engages Mateo (discarding {%card Olive McBride%} from hand), who can hopefully evade it until Michael gets a gun into play. Mateo draws {%card Olive McBride%} and Michael draws {%card Lucky Cigarette Case%}.

## Round 11

We're at the mercy of the mythos here. Our board state is tenuous, with the {%card Deep One Bull%} and no immediate way to deal with it, and {%card The Amalgam%} on us in two rounds. Another enemy would be pretty disasterous. Mateo thus draws {%card Young Deep One%}, taking a horror which Olive soaks. Michael draws {%card Swarm of Rats%} which will cost us a valuable action to deal with. Not good.

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-04-20-ahlcg-a-gangsters-repentance-1/R0001085.JPG" />

Michael punches the {%card Swarm of Rats%} successfully, then plays {%card Luger P08%}. The alternative is gaining a resource and paying something bigger like the {%card .41 Derringer%}, but that would mean not having actions to fight and thus missing out on this round's free trigger of Michael's ability. Using the free Luger trigger, targetting the {%card Young Deep One%}, Michael shoots and scores a damage, then follows up with a basic fight action, committing one of the {%card .41 Derringer%}s to be +3, which also succeeds. Next round, the Luger can finish off the {%card Young Deep One%}, giving enough resources to play {%card .41 Derringer%} to fight the bull and abomination.

Mateo has some evading to do, and isn't going to get much help in the form of commits. First, the {%card Deep One Bull%}. I'm still not sure if Olive is beneficial here, testing at +1, but lets give her a go. We pull an {%icon tent%} (-3), {%icon -3%}, and {%icon bless%}. {%card Ancient Covenant%} means we don't have to draw another token after the {%icon bless%}, so resolving that and a {%icon -3%} means we pass by 0! The problem now is the {%card Young Deep One%} which is a 3 vs 3 test, with no Olive or Covenant to help out. The risk of trying is a damage or horror from the {%icon cult%} or {%icon tab%}, though there is only one of each in the bag now. Lets go for it. {%icon cult%}, that's a fail and a damage. Again. A {%icon bless%}, followed by... an {%icon tent%}. That's the worst case, removing a {%icon bless%} and still failing. Oh well.

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-04-20-ahlcg-a-gangsters-repentance-1/R0001048.JPG" />

During the enemy phase, {%card The Amalgam%} hunts, it's now only one turn away. Mateo takes one and one from the {%card Young Deep One%} and is re-engaged by the {%card Deep One Bull%} (discarding {%card Arcane Studies%} this time). Mateo draws {%card Holy Rosary%} and Michael draws {%card Hard Knocks%}.

## Round 12

Mateo: {%card Arcane Studies%} {%card Prescient%} {%card Holy Rosary%}
Michael: {%card .18 Derringer%} {%card .41 Derringer%} {%card Lucky Cigarette Case%} {%card Hard Knocks%}

Four of eight doom, which leaves us four round before presumably everything is flooded. Mateo needs to stop evading and get the two keys required to escape, but that puts a lot of burden on Michael to deal with the three enemies, with potentially more incoming. But first, the mythos gifts Mateo yet another {%card Swarm of Rats%}, and Michael yet another another {%card Swarm of Rats%}. This is starting to look pretty dire.

Michael uses the {%card Luger P08%} to finish off the {%card Young Deep One%}, before punching his own {%card Swarm of Rats%} and playing {%card .41 Derringer%} with the resource gained from the Luger. Finally, he punches Mateo's rats.

This feels like a tipping point for the scenario now. If Mateo manages to evade the bull one more time, he can move to the {%card Idol Chamber%} to get the key. This leaves Michael in a pricarious situation, but there's not really another option. If the evade fails, we're stuck here another round and it's all but over. So, Mateo goes for the evade on {%card Deep One Bull%}, and Michael commits {%card Hard Knocks%} to make it +2. Mateo pulls a skull which is {%icon -2%} and a pass! The bull is exhausted after being given the run-around, and Mateo legs it to the {%card Idol Chamber%} and investigates using {%card Clairvoyance%}. Committing his entire hand, {%card Prescient%} (naming symbol) and {%card Holy Rosary%}, he pulls a skull, which is a success and allows him to take {%card Ward of Protection%} back into his hand. With the location cleared of clues, the blue key is free for the taking, which represents "an idol of a malformed aquatic creature".

In the enemy phase, {%card The Amalgam%} hunts into the {%card Fish Graveyard%}, engaging and attacking Michael, and stealing his key. Then, the {%card Deep One Bull%} readies and engages, causing Michael to discard {%card Lucky Cigarette Case%}. Mateo draws {%card Holy Rosary%} and Michael draws a replacement {%card Lucky Cigarette Case%}.

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-04-20-ahlcg-a-gangsters-repentance-1/R0001088.JPG" />

## Round 13

Mateo draws {%card Deep One Assault%} and in the history of Arkham Horror, no encounter card has ever been cancelled as fast. Michael draws {%card Memory of Oblivion%} which essentially means discarding his whole hand barring a miracle from the chaos bag. He pulls a {%icon -1%} which is a failure by 2, and {%card .18 Derringer%} and {%card Lucky Cigarette Case%} are discarded.

Mateo rushes through Michael and his two fishy buddies in the {%card Fish Graveyard%}, entering the {%card Altar to Dagon%}, before placing the aquatic statue on the altar and gaining the green key in return, "an emerald key with four prongs".

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-04-20-ahlcg-a-gangsters-repentance-1/R0001091.JPG" />

Michael shoots {%card The Amalgam%} with the {%card .41 Derringer%}, pulls an {%icon tent%} which means a glancing blow and only one damage. Going again, he pulls and elder sign, causing {%card The Amalgam%} to retreat to the depths and putting an extra bullet on the Derringer. As his last action, he needs to evade the {%card Deep One Bull%} or take two damage from it, leaving him on one health. With nothing to commit, there's nothing for it but to pull... a {%icon bless%} token, putting him at +3, followed by... an {%icon tent%}, which is a success by 0! Pulling the {%icon tent%} without the {%icon bless%} would have been catastrophic, leading to the immediate return of {%card The Amalgam%}, Michael's death, and the blocking of Mateo's escape.

After an un-eventful enemy phase for once, the bull re-engages on Michael and at least doesn't cause a discard from Michael's empty hand. Mateo draws his second {%card Keep Faith%}, which could come in clutch, and Michael draws {%card Robert Castaigne%}, though doesn't have the freedom to play him yet.

## Round 14

Mateo: {%card Holy Rosary%} {%card Keep Faith%}
Michael: {%card Robert Castaigne%}

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-04-20-ahlcg-a-gangsters-repentance-1/R0001095.JPG" />

Six out of Eight doom. Mythos, Mateo draws {%card Rising Tides%} which floods the {%card Altar to Dagon%} which seems appropriate considering he just activated the altar and presumably triggered the 'drown them before they can escape!' trap. Michael draws {%card Macabre Memento%}, which is no threat itself since Michael can take the horror, but the risk of drawing the {%icon tent%} and bringing back {%card The Amalgam%} is significant. Mateo, during the player window, will play {%card Keep Faith%} which, albeit only slightly, reduces the odds of Michael failing with the {%icon tent%} (he would have to draw 2x{%icon bless%} followed by the {%icon tent%} to succeed with it). Michael's {%card Dreams of R'lyeh%} means the test is two vs three, and losing would put him on one sanity. He pulls a {%icon -2%}.

Mateo once again dashes past Michael and the {%card Deep One Bull%}, entering the {%card Underground River%}, which is a safe-haven since it can't be fully flooded. Next round he has the option of attempting to grab the final purple key from the one remaining unrevealed location, then triggering flashback four. Though this seems particularly optimistic.

Michael can't really hope to defeat the {%card Deep One Bull%} without more firepower, so an evade is the only option. With 5x{%icon bless%} in the bag, there's a decent chance of success. First attempt, he pulls... a {%icon 0%}! Finally, things seem to be turning around. Michael then finally gets to leave the fishy graveyard and join Mateo in the underground river.

During upkeep, Mateo draws {%card Favor of the Sun%} which might prove pivotal. Michael draws {%card Overpower%}.

## Round 15

Mateo draws {%card From the Depths%}, bringing {%card The Amalgam%} back for, I've lost count, the fifth time now? This dude really doesn't take no for an answer. Michael draws {%card Undertow%}, which enters his threat area.

Michael doesn't need to move yet, so {%card Undertow%} isn't a bridge we need to cross right now. More important is freeing Mateo from {%card The Amalgam%} so he can grab the purple key. He will finally play {%card Robert Castaigne%}, providing some additional firepower and some potentially crucial soak. Then, he takes aim with the {%card .41 Derringer%} at 8 vs 3, and pulls... a {%icon bless%} token. Activating {%card Ancient Covenant%} is an option here, since Mateo is at our location, but it seems unnecessary. A {%icon -3%} follows, which means two damage to the abomination. As his final action, Michael spends the resource just gained to reload the {%card Luger P08%}, before triggering the free fight ability. Another elder sign! That's another ammo for the Derringer and {%card The Amalgam%} defeated once more. Hopefully that's the last we see of it. {%card Deep One Bull%} does hear the engagement and moves closer.

Mateo explores south and reveals the second {%card Tidal Pool%}. He plays {%card Favor of the Sun%}, sealing three of the four {%icon bless%} tokens on it. He then investigates with {%card Clairvoyance%}, resolving a {%icon bless%} sealed on {%card Favor of the Sun%}, and triggering {%card Ancient Covenant%} to prevent pulling another token. That's the two clues and the key gained, which is 'a jagged key of marble and onyx'.

Upkeep, Mateo draws {%card Rite of Sanctification%}, and Michael draws {%card Luger P08%}. 

## Round 16

Mateo: {%card Holy Rosary%} {%card Rite of Sanctification%}
Michael: {%card Overpower%} {%card Luger P08%}

Eight of eight doom, the agenda advances. Everywhere becomes fully flooded, except the {%card Underground River%}s which can't be. Thankfully, we can utilise one of them as the last vestige of solid ground to grab the final flashback and then make our escape.

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-04-20-ahlcg-a-gangsters-repentance-1/R0001099.JPG" />

Mateo draws {%card Lurking Deep One%}, taking a damage from the engage. Michael draws {%card From the Depths%}. Unbelievable, there really is no end to it.

Mateo begins by evading the {%card Lurking Deep One%}, using the same combo of {%card Favor of the Sun%} and {%card Ancient Covenant%} to guarantee success. He then moves back to the underground river. Without enough actions to move into the {%card Idol Chamber%} and back, he has to stay put, drawing a card instead, {%card Flashlight%}.

Michael now has a problem. Defeating {%card The Amalgam%} once more would mean luring the {%card Deep One Bull%} to our location. It's probably better to keep it evaded. Three chances at 3 vs 1... First go, is a {%icon bless%} followed by a {%icon -4%} which is still a failure. Second attempt, autofail. Third time lucky... {%icon -1%}, it's evaded.

Upkeep, it engages again with Michael. Mateo draws {%card Prescient%} and Michael draws {%card Crack Shot%}.

## Round 17

Mateo draws the final card in the encounter deck, {%card Blindsense%}. An agility 3 test that, if failed, would cause {%card The Amalgam%} to engage and attack. We could guarantee the success with our {%icon bless%} combo, but we could also have Olive soak the attack and use the free engage and our bless combo for a guaranteed evade, leaving us enough actions to move to the {%card Idol Chamber%}, trigger the flashback, and get back. That doesn't seem too bad, so Mateo is going to do the test. He draws a skull, so a failure and gets hit, which Olive takes. Encounter discard gets shuffled, and Michael draws another {%card Macabre Memento%}. Looks like {%card Robert Castaigne%} is taking this one, but miracles can happen. Not this day. Two horror goes to Robert which takes him out.

Mateo will use {%card Favor of the Sun%} and {%card Ancient Covenant%} one last time to evade {%card The Amalgam%}, before dashing back to the {%card Idol Chamber%} to use the marble and onyx key to open the door at the far end of the chamber. Doing so reveals two statues which trigger a flashback in a dark dingy basement where some sort cult is performing a ritual. Finally, we get to remove an {%icon tent%} from the bag! Considering the amount of pain it's caused in this scenario, it's about time. That's all the objectives complete, which I didn't expect just a few rounds ago, all that remains is getting to the exit and resigning. Mateo swims back to the underground river, the only piece of dry land remaining.

With {%card The Amalgam%} exhausted, Michael is free to move to the exit, but that would leave Mateo to deal with it next round. He also can't defeat it without pulling in the {%card Deep One Bull%}. Both need three actions move to the exit and resign, and with at least one action required to evade {%card The Amalgam%}, it seems we can't quite close this one out next round. The best we can do is draw for cards to commit to the evade, and also get rid of {%card Undertow%}. To that end, Michael discards the {%card .18 Derringer%} and commits {%card Overpower%}, testing 7 vs 3. Pulling a {%icon -4%}, he also pulls himself out of the river and draws {%card Crack Shot%}, which doesn't help with the evade. Drawing again, a {%card .45 Automatic%}, and again, {%card Remington Model 1858%}.

Upkeep, {%card The Amalgam%} enages Michael, who draws {%card Pilfer%}. Mateo draws {%card Radiant Smite%}.

## Round 18

Mateo: {%card Holy Rosary%} {%card Rite of Sanctification%} {%card Flashlight%} {%card Prescient%} {%card Radiant Smite%}
Michael: {%card Crack Shot%} {%card Crack Shot%} {%card .45 Automatic%} {%card Remington Model 1858%} {%card Pilfer%}

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-04-20-ahlcg-a-gangsters-repentance-1/R0001100.JPG" />

The mythos provides Mateo with {%card Memory of Oblivion%}. We have lots to commit to this, but we discard cards by each point we fail by so it's net neutral. Mateo pulls {%icon -1%}, so discards {%card Rite of Sanctification%}. Michael draws {%card Riptide%}, which is absolutely fine. The test fails and he loses {%card "Viola" Case%} to the rapids, no harm done.

The end is so close we start to smell the fresh air in anticipation. In the most important evade of Michael's life, he commits {%card Pilfer%} {%card Remington Model 1858%} {%card .45 Automatic%} to go +4 against {%card The Amalgam%}. Pullling a {%icon -3%}, the abomination is exhausted one final time and Michael dashes to the {%card Sealed Exit%}, but can't yet resign. Mateo follows, but isn't going to leave his friend behind. One more round and this horrific experience will be behind us.

During upkeep, Mateo draws {%card Arcane Studies%}, and Michael draws {%card Manual Dexterity%}, both the final cards in their respective decks.

## Round 19

Three our of four doom, the last round of the scenario. Mateo draws {%card Fractured Consciousness%}! Disaster, this could kill Mateo who only has two health remaining. He commits {%card Flashlight%} and {%card Arcane Studies%} to go +2. With no {%icon bless%} in the bag, and on a fully flooded location, Mateo's chances are slim. Pullling a {%icon -1%}, he makes it through. Michael draws {%card From the Depths%}, but it surges. {%card Rising Tides%} also surges. {%card Memory of Oblivion%} is Michael's final hurdle, and pulling a {%icon tab%} would turn him insane. It's... a {%icon 0%}. He discards two cards but is otherwise unharmed.

Mateo takes the emerald, four pronged key and unlocks the sewer grate. He steps through into the fresh air and freedom from the nightmare. He then locks the grate behind him and throws the key back through. Michael catches the key and unlocks the grate once more, rejoining his friend on the other side.

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-04-20-ahlcg-a-gangsters-repentance-1/R0001101.JPG" />

It's over, and not a moment too soon. One more round and the doom clock would have chimed midnight, and Michael would have shuffled his deck, being defeated by horror in the process. {%card The Amalgam%} isn't far behind, and as Mateo and Michael walk away, they hear it slam into the grate behind them, its fleshy appendages thrashing at the bars.

# Epilogue

Just before passing out from exhaustion, Mateo and Michael are roused by black-haired woman they don't recognise, though she recognises them. Turns out she's the Elina Harper they were tasked to find in the meeting with Agent Dawson (now part of the abomination they just escaped). After catching up on details and sharing with Harper the extra flashbacks they both experienced, when pressed on remembering how you arrived in Innsmouth, a new flashback is triggered which has Mateo and Michael being driven in Dawson's car into the cursed down to find Elina, five weeks earlier. Enter Scenario II: The Vanishing of Elina Harper.

# Thoughts

## Scenario

Wow, that was a wild ride. I won't pretend we didn't get very lucky at points, things always seems to be balancing on the precipice, but that's what Arkham Horror LCG does so well. A singular unlucky pull from the bag at many points near the end could either have resulted in one or both investigator defeats, or the failure to unlock all the flashbacks.

I thoroughly enjoy The Pit of Despair as an opening scenario. It sets up lots of the mechanics that will recurr over the campaign such as the cave locations and engage triggers on the enemies. The encounter sets, especially Rising Tides, are very flavorful and often created tense and thematic situations. Random location placement can often be a problem though, and in this playthrough we saw both sides of that. The placement of {%card Underground River%} betwen the final few locations and the exit allowed us an extra few rounds into agenda 3, which ultimately meant the removal of an extra chaos token for the whole campaign which is a huge deal. I'm not sure if there are any balancing mechanics for this later in the campaign, since a poor performance on this scenario could make the rest of the campaign significantly more difficult. However, the {%card Underwater Cavern%} were not useful at all, and potentially could have saved multiple move actions which are at a premium when only playing with two investigators.

I think my biggest mistake was not picking up the blue key while on its location. For some reason I thought the key was tied to the free action on {%card Idol Chamber%} and couldn't be taken. It cost Mateo four move actions and caused Michael to spend an extra round juggling enemies.

## Investigators
## Investigators

Michael McGlen performed admirably here, considering the amount of enemies there were. His weaknesses are very punishing, and due to the unfortunate draw of {%card Paranoia%}, had resource problems for most of the scenario. {%card Confiscation%} was unfortunately followed up by enemy draws in the mythos phase which left him on the back foot, and {%card Bum's Rush%} was a useful card to have in these situations. Getting {%card Robert Castaigne%} out on the fist round might have been better than the guns, knowing that encounter cards that discard from hand exist. It's easier to draw another gun than another Castaigne. Michael ended up evading more than expected, but mostly due to {%card The Amalgam%} and its interaction with {%card Deep One Bull%}. His three agility makes this possible but not easy. I underestimated {%card Luger P08%}, it's a workhorse resource generator for Michael, though probably not a great pick for any other investigator.

Mateo had no trouble with clues, {%card Clairvoyance%} putting in work. Two player definitely feels great to play with extra clue gathering, as hoovering up most locations with one action is very powerful. The {%card Favor of the Sun%} and {%card Ancient Covenant%} combo came into play late but was clutch in closing out the scenario. Unfortunately we drew no good ways to add {%icon bless%} to the bag early, and {%card Rite of Sanctification%} was as dead draw. It would have helped out a lot with Michael's resource problems, and helped fund {%card Hand of Fate%} to keep the bag topped up. He's definitely reliant on drawing {%card Keep Faith%} early and that didn't happen this time. I'm not sure about {%card Olive McBride%}, she does compliment cards like {%card Ward of Radiance%} and {%card Prescient%}, but for the most part reduces the chance of success in typical tests. I think replacing with {%card Priest of Two Faiths%} is a solid option (unfortunately we're blocked from upgrading until after the next scenario).
