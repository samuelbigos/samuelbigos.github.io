[Sculpt by NS Miniatures](https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-cthulhu-the-great-old-one-390668)

My Arkham Horror LCG group is about to play the finale of The Drowned City and I wanted to surprise them with this monstrous rendition of the biggest baddest sleepy boi.

I'm by no means a great miniature painter but I thought it would be fun to give a brief step-by-step of how I went about it.

## Printing

The sculpt was an easy print on my Elegoo Saturn 2. I usually distrust pre-supported models but NS Miniatures did a great job with this one and they worked great. Everything fit together snugly though the tentacles attached to the base have a somewhat ambiguous rotation.

## Paints
This are the paints I used. Obviously these can be swapped out for similar tones from other brands. A useful app for paint matching is [paintRack](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.courageousoctopus.paintrack&hl=en_GB).

* Vallejo Nocturnal Red
* Vallejo Cayman Green
* Vallejo Dead Flesh
* Vallejo Toxic Yellow
* Citadel Reikland Fleshtone
* Citadel Nuln Oil
* Vallejo Night Blue
* Vallejo Turquoise
* Vallejo Wolf Grey
* Vallejo Succubus Skin
* Vallejo Dead White 
* Vallejo Bloody Red
* Vallejo Orange Fire
* Vallejo Black
* Matt Varnish
* Satin Varnish (optional)
* Gloss Varnish

## Base coats

### 1. Airbrush dark/black primer

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-06-08-cthulhu-painting/R0001187.JPG" />

### 2. Airbrush Nocturnal Red on all the fleshy parts
This will give a lovely red hue to the shadows that will compliment the green of the flesh.

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-06-08-cthulhu-painting/R0001188.JPG" />

### 3. Airbrush Cayman Green from above/sides
This is the primary skin tone. Apply from above and going down to just above horizontal to leave the red in the shadowed regions.

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-06-08-cthulhu-painting/R0001189.JPG" />

### 4. Airbrush Dead Flesh from above

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-06-08-cthulhu-painting/R0001190.JPG" />

### 5. Airbrush Toxic Yellow (or anything pale/yellow-greenish) on wing membrane
This was intended to represent more light shining through the membranous wings, not sure if it really worked.

### 6. Paint water with blend of blues

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-06-08-cthulhu-painting/R0001200.JPG" />

Start by painting all water with pure Night Blue.

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-06-08-cthulhu-painting/R0001202.JPG" />

Progressively wet blend in lighter colours on waves and tips of waves.

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-06-08-cthulhu-painting/R0001204.JPG" />

Go up to a blend of Turquoise and Wolf Grey on the wave peaks. We will drybrush pure Wolf Grey later around the rocks and tentacles for the foam.

### 7. Basecoat rocks with Vallejo Cold Grey
(image above)

### 8. Glaze turquoise up bottom of the flesh emerging from water
This will help ground Cthulhu in the water and make it look like he's actually emerging.

## Shading

### 1. Shade wing membrane with Citadel Reikland Fleshtone
I'm actually not sure if this would have been better shaded with the same tone as the rest of the flesh... I'd probably do that in hindsight.

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-06-08-cthulhu-painting/R0001196.JPG" />

### 2. Shade flesh including tentacles with Nuln Oil + Nocturnal Red mix
We want to shade the crevasses with the same dark red tone we initially basecoated in. I took a base of Nuln Oil and added Nocturnal Red to it. I thinned it a bit more to offset the added pigment, or the shade would be a bit too aggressive.

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-06-08-cthulhu-painting/R0001213.JPG" />

### 3. Shade water with Nuln Oil + Night Blue mix
Blend this water shade with the flesh shade above on all the fleshy parts emerging from the water, for a nice transition.

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-06-08-cthulhu-painting/R0001212.JPG" />

## Highlighting

### 1. Paint the tentacle suckers Succubus Skin

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-06-08-cthulhu-painting/R0001216.JPG" />

Once dry, re-shade with the flesh shade mix used above.

Once that's dry, do a final dot highlight mixing in Wolf Grey. A single dot will give the impression of a glossy slimy sucker (we'll add gloss varnish later).

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-06-08-cthulhu-painting/R0001219.JPG" />

### 2. Glaze Cayman Green and Dead Flesh mix on raised parts of flesh including tentacles
Thin Cayman Green with water or glaze medium, and add some Dead Flesh to it. Gently brush it over the raised parts of the flesh that should be highlighted. Keep your brush strokes aligned with the muscle fibres where possible. 

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-06-08-cthulhu-painting/R0001214.JPG" />
<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-06-08-cthulhu-painting/R0001215.JPG" />

Be patient and don't add too much Dead Flesh at once and keep the paint thin. Keep going until you're glazing mostly pure dead flesh on the most raised parts, like the forehead and cheek bones and tentacles.

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-06-08-cthulhu-painting/R0001217.JPG" />

I mostly focused on the head, chest, arms, and tentacles. I didn't highlight the wings, either the front or back, mostly because I was under time pressure.

### 3. Drybrush water foam with Wolf Grey
Get a stiff brush, load with Wolf Grey then rub most of it off (more than you think). Then wipe back and forth on the water around where the rocks and flesh is emerging. Don't be afraid to get foam on the rocks or flesh.

## Finishes

### 1. Eyes
1. I gave Cthulhu red eyes to match the AHLCG artwork, but for some more detail gave him (it?) a vertically elongated orange iris and black pupil.

2. To do this, first paint the whole eye in Dead White. White has much better coverage than red, so the red will go on much easier over white.

3. Then, paint over the white with Bloody Red.

4. Then, again with white, add a vertical slit for the iris, then paint over it with Orange Fire.

5. Finally, with Black, make an even thinner vertical slit for the pupil.

### 2. Outline the base in Black

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-06-08-cthulhu-painting/R0001222.JPG" />

### 3. Varnish in 80 : 20 mix of Matt to Satin (or just 100% Matt)
I airbrush this on in a couple of layers. Mixing in some satin varnish is a tip I got from Vince Venturella, which makes the varnish more durable while not adding any noticeable satin gloss.

<img class="full" src="/assets/2025-06-08-cthulhu-painting/R0001225.JPG" />

### 4. Brush gloss varnish on suckers and eyes
Makes the suckers look like they're covered in slime, and makes the eyes pop.

## Fin!
I'm happy with the result, for a day's work. The green flesh with red shadows works really well, and I'm pleased with the water blend and the blends on the flesh emerging from the water. The eyes also turned out great.

The wings are the weak point, since I didn't expend any effort on them at all. I'm not totally sure what could be done to improve them though.
