# Upgrades

## Michael McGlen

There are a lot of good options here, but the priority has to be consistency in fighting. To that end, {%card Locked and Loaded%} means every gun we play lasts longer before being replaced, saving resources, while also giving more ammo to turn into resources. It's as much an eco card as it is efficiency (fewer actions spent replacing guns). It's permanent so we're guaranteed to have it. It's the best upgrade for us right now.

The remaining two XP is more open. {%card Extra Ammunition%} accomplishes the same thing as Locked and Loaded but costs resources instead of giving them. {%card Bound for the Horizon%} is incredibly tempting as actions are always at a premium. The downside is it's hard to draw, and we have other ways to discard cards ({%card Robert Castaigne%}. {%card .41 Derringer(2)%} is the best option for Michael right now, I think. Succeeding by 3 isn't so difficult with Michael, and the payoff is incredible. Plus it makes the two damage more consistent, which is the main downside of the level 0 version.

## Father Mateo

{%card Olive McBride%} underperformed in Pit of Despair. I don't think her upgrade would fare a whole lot better, so replacing her with {%card Priest of Two Faiths%} seems like the right play here. Sorry Olive! The priest gives us two things, more bless tokens which our deck relies on a lot, and more health soak. The idea will be to play him and then let him take a bullet for us within a round or two, limiting our curse exposure.

Mateo's remaining 3XP could go towards {%card Rite of Seeking(2)%}. We got lucky drawing {%card Clairvoyance%} last scenario, we can't always count on that, and having another spell capable of grabbing clues in twos will improve consistency. Another legitimate option is {%card Custom Ammunition%}. Michael is already increasing the ammo count on his guns so this could potentially give him six shots of three damage each. Deep Ones are all monsters so there should be no shortage of targets, though the scenario we're about to start is a flashback to when we're exploring Innsmouth, we'll probably be fighting the townsfolk as much as full-on Deep Ones. Mateo could also take {%card Charisma%} and keep both Olive and Priest of Two Faiths. {%card Holy Rosary(2)%} is also a solid option.

It's a difficulty decision, but Mateo is going to go for a copy of {%card Rite of Seeking(2)%}. The consistency of going from two to three powerful investigation spells is too good to pass up. It will replace one copy of {%card Arcane Studies%}, which was a dead card last scenario, one of those should be enough.

# Scenario 2 - The Vanishing of Elina Harper

[Explain leads deck]

## Round 1

Mateo isn't off to a great start. His first hand pre-mulligan is {%card Prescient%}, {%card Guts%}, {%card Favor of the Sun%}, {%card Rite of Sanctificadtion%}, and {%card Guts%}. That's nothing useful, so a full redraw gives {%card The Codex of Ages%}, {%card Enraptured%}, {%card Holy Rosary%}, {%card Prescient%},  and {%card Ward of Protection%}. No better, really. This was the situation I was worried about, and why we added {%card Rite of Seeking(2)%} to the deck. We'll have to do a bit of hunting which will slow us down.

Luckily, Michael fares better, drawing {%card Luger P08%} and mulliganing the rest looking for {%card Robert Castaigne%}. Michael finds him, along with a {%card .41 Derringer%}, {%card "Viola" Case%}, and {%card Pilfer%}, which might help investigations until Mateo can find some spells.

{%card The Little Bookshop%} is a nice target for Michael's {%card Pilfer%}, low shroud and enough clues to make it worthwhile. Failing a test here provides false leads, gunking up the leads deck. However, that will have to wait a while because the locals are looking suspicious and resources must be spent getting {%card Robert Castaigne%} and {%card Luger P08%} into play, the latter coming in with an extra ammo thanks to {%card Locked and Loaded%}. Spending an action gaining a resouce doesn't feel great, but now we're ready for whatever enemies the mythos throws our way.

Mateo begins searching for his spells. He draws another {%card Prescient%}, followed by a {%card Guts%}. Another draw would mean discarding in the upkeep phase, so he dons his {%card Holy Rosary%}.

In the upkeep phase, Mateo draws {%card Favor of the Sun%}, still not what we want to see. Michael draws {%card "You've had Worse"%}.

## Round 2

Mateo draws {%card Obscuring Fog%}. Michael draws {%card Initiate of Dagon%}.
