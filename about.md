# About

I'm a game developer who's worked at a bunch of studios in a bunch of locations (currently Brighton, UK). Professionally I work as a generalist engineer, but independently I expand into design, art, and rendering stuff. He/him.

When possible I make my work public on [my GitHub](https://github.com/samuelbigos) to give back to the game development community. Godot is my favourite engine to develop for, and you can see the game projects and jams I've worked on on [my itch.io](https://sambigos.itch.io/).

My favourite mechanical game genre is RTS, but I also love a short, focused, and compelling story-driven game. I read primarily sci-fi and horror (best when combined), my favourite authors are Stephen King (The Dark Tower), Dan Simmons (Hyperion), Neal Stephenson (Anathem), Liu Cixin (The Dark Forest), and Peter Watts (Blindsight). See what I'm reading on [my Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54024456-sam).

If you want to contact me, the best way is send me a message on [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/home).
